PhD Student at Newcastle University under [Sustainable Electrical Propulsion CDT](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/electric-propulsion/), partnered by [Dyson](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/electric-propulsion/our-students/cohortfour/profilenailtosun.html) , [METU](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/) alumni, [PowerLab member](https://odtu.github.io/).  
in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.


Check my [scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2_zTqOwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Researchgate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nail-Tosun) for recent pubs. 

Currently, I am working on mostly power electronics (variable speed motor drives, current source inverters etc.). However I have a wide electrical machine experience; both rotating (terrible slow giant generators too very high speed micro motors: 100 rpm-40 MW 100W-100krpm) and linear machines (railguns). My MSc studies includes control courses as well and yes I am not interested on peoples MPC algorithms.
